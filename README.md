# Fallen Stars.

The game I have decided to create is a puzzle game that uses
perspective to challenge the player to create different shapes out of stars by
rotating different orbs on the controller. The player will be exploring an
abandoned Astronomy centre for hidden treasure supposedly hidden there by the
founders of the building. There will be multiple different puzzles based off
changing the playerâ€™s perspective of the puzzle and redirecting light for
different effect. The puzzles could be represented in the game through
holographic images, this would potentially set the game in the future.


The electrical components that make up the controller for
the game will be encased in a medium sized rectangular box and will have seven
orbs which will control different things during the game such as how the
puzzles are solved and how he player moves throughout the game. There will also
be two buttons in the bottom right hand corner of the box to act as a pause button
and an action button to add more functionality to the game. On the side, there
will be an on/off switch with a port for powering the Arduino. If the bottom
was connected by a latch or screws it would keep it secure while allowing for
easy access to any components needing changing inside.
